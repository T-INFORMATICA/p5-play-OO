This project enables you to use ES2016 classes along with the p5.play sprites.

This project is intended to teach students the use of classes and object-oriented programming.

## Creating a class

 1. Create a file called `[YourClassName].js`
 2. Add the file in `index.html` using a `<script>` element
 3. Write the base code for the class in `[YourClassName].js`
 4. Create an object for that class
 5. Write the rest of the code for your class
